No. 8: Un client TCP trimite unui server un numar. Serverul va returna 
clientului sirul divizorilor acestui numar.

The client sends the number to the server on 4 bytes. The number will be
greater than 0.

If the server doesn't receive anything in 15 seconds time, it will close
the connection and send back the integer value -1 as an error code
(represented on 4 bytes).

After successfully receiving the number, the server will compute
its divisors.

If the client doesn't receive anything in 10 seconds time after sending the
number, it will close the connection and shut itself down.

The server sends to the client an error code represented on 4 bytes (signed),
with the following meaning:

	0 -> everything was ok
	-1 -> timeout error
	
If the error code is 0, the server sends the array containing all the divisors,
each represented on 4 bytes unsigned.
